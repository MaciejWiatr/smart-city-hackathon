### Tourder

Tourder is a travel app prototype created for a smart city hackathon in Kraków, designed to simplify city exploration. It works like a “Tinder for tours”: visitors swipe right or left on local attractions and events, and the app generates a personalized travel plan based on their choices. Over time, Tourder learns from each user’s preferences to better match future recommendations.

Whether discovering popular sights or hidden gems, Tourder helps tourists experience Kraków and other cities in a way that suits their tastes.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
